# Building accessible experiences using AI
AI can be a game changer for people with disabilities. Already we’re witnessing this as people with disabilities expand their use of computers to hear, see and reason with impressive accuracy.

At Microsoft we’ve been putting to work stronger solutions such as real-time speech-to-text transcription, visual recognition services and predictive text functionality. AI advances like these offer enormous potential by enabling people with vision, hearing, cognitive, learning, mobility disabilities and mental health conditions do more in three specific scenarios: employment, modern life and human connection.

In this session we dive into the tools and services that are available for you to create solutions that are more accessible and inclusive.

The session will be packed with demos, use cases and lot's of tips and tricks.

Join this session and learn how you can help building the future of disability inclusion and accessibility.
